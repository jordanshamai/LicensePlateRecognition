# 🚗 License Plate Detection & OCR System  
**Built with YOLOv8 + PaddleOCR (formerly EasyOCR) — Fine-Tuned with Roboflow**

> An end-to-end system for detecting and recognizing license plates in real-world conditions using state-of-the-art computer vision and OCR.

---

## 🔍 What It Does

This project combines **YOLOv8** for robust license plate detection with **PaddleOCR** for high-accuracy recognition of plate numbers. Originally prototyped with **EasyOCR**, we transitioned to **PaddleOCR** for better fine-tuning and real-world performance.

## 🎯 Features

- ⚡ **YOLOv8** custom-trained for license plate detection  
- 🔤 **PaddleOCR** used for text recognition, fine-tuned with private data  
- 🧪 **EasyOCR** was initially tested for OCR performance  
- 📦 Designed for modular use in apps, edge devices, or surveillance systems  
- 🧱 Built with scalability and deployment in mind

## 🧠 Model Training

### 🏷️ Object Detection
- Framework: [Ultralytics YOLOv8](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)
- Dataset: Fine-tuned with annotated license plate datasets from [Roboflow Universe](https://universe.roboflow.com/search?q=class%3A%22license+plate%22)

### 🔡 OCR
- Initial prototype: [EasyOCR](https://github.com/JaidedAI/EasyOCR)  
- Final system: [PaddleOCR](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleOCR) with private fine-tuned dataset
